## Project Overview

ScholarSource is a cutting-edge solution in the field of education technology. It uses next-generation blockchain contracts (with the hope of later supporting zero-knowledge proofs through Aleo) to ensure security when crowdfunding educational scholarships for underserved students across the world. While our product is still in its early stages, ScholarSource promises an exciting new educational future for those who need it most.

## Improvements with Aleo Tokens

In future iterations of our app, we wish to support zero-knowledge blockchain technology with the power of Aleo. A demo of this mechanism is included in the leo_token folder, which can be deployed by running 'bash ./deploy.sh' from the command line. ALEO technology is still in the very early stages so we have not yet been able to integrate it with our frontend system; however, the app could
eventually, support more secure transactions by using transfers of Aleo tokens rather than Solidity contracts when funding grants.
